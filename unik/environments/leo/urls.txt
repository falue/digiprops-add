# URL and favorites list
# Comma and space seperated list:
#   showInFavorites, material_icon, real_url, spoof_url, optional onclick function
#      showInFavorites: "show" or "hide" determines if the URL is in the favorites list
#      material_icon: Available icons see https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons:settings
#      real_url: Enter the path to your local index file or enter any valid real URL.
#                If real_url is "./", it will not have become link but will be displayed as a spoof favorite.
#      spoof_url: The Url to enter in the URL bar to visit site. Also, its the display name of the favorite.
#                 If this contains a "$" sign, the spoof_url will be split in two:
#                 First part before the "$" sign: URL to visit site will be the first part. The part after
#                 the "$" sign will be displayed only in the URL overview (top right) eg. for better naming
#                 of different scenes with the same URL.
#                 Example: www.qsearch.ch$Scene 444 title
#      optional onclick function: Optional javascript function to execute.
# First entry of this list is also acting as the home page.
